# Source-code-of-Levy-NSGA--
This is the source code of Levy-NSGA-Ⅱ for solving two-phase dynamic virtual cellular formation (DVCF) problem.
There are seven groups of cases in total. Each group includes a first phase case and a second phase case. 
For example,in the folder “Levy-NSGAⅡ_the first phase”, the machinedata_1 and the processingdata_1 is the resouce information 
and the part information of case 1 in the first phase.
